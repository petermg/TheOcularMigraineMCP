# The Ocular Migraine {Dev Mode} Master Control Program.

### This is an applicaiton for use with the Oculus / Meta Quest mobile VR headsets, including the original Oculus Quest, Oculus / Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, Meta Quest 3.
Installation.
1. Make sure your device is in developer mode. If it isn't, watch this 60 second video here which shows you how: https://youtu.be/jB1gwgSpU3E

2. Download the zip file "Install.zip" https://github.com/petermg/TheOcularMigraineMCP/releases/download/v1.0/Install.zip and extract it to any folder on your computer.

3. Download the latest version of The Oculus Migraine apk file from the latest releses here: https://github.com/petermg/TheOcularMigraineMCP/releases

4. Take the APK you downloaded and drag and DROP it onto the bat file named "Installation.bat" from the zip file "Install.zip" that you extracted earlier and follow the onscreen prompts. DO NOT CLOSE THE BAT FILE WINDOW after the file has been installed! Press any key to continue as it then runs the command "adb tcpip 5555" which opens up the port on the Quest for this application to authenticate itself on the very first run. This is the one and **ONLY** time your PC will be required for this!

5. Put on your headset.

6. Go to UNKNOWN SOURCES.

7. Click on "The Ocular Migraine".

8. After it begins to load, you will be prompted a total of 3 different times with a prompt that says "Allow USB debugging?". Each time you must select the option at the bottom which says "Always allow from this computer". After you select this option the first time, the applicaiton will close. Launch it again by clicking on it from UNKNOWN SOURCES and you will be propmted 2 more times to "Allow USB debugging?" Again select "Always allow from this computer".

9. Now once the app is up and running, select "MISC" from the bottom and it will take you to the MISC page.

10. Select "Battery Optimization Settings" to open the Battery optimization settings.

11. Make sure "The Ocular Migraine" is set to "NOT OPTIMIZED". By default soon after this application is installed, the Quest will "optimize" it, which ends up KILLING the app from running in the background. This prevents the app from being able to initiate custom gaming profiles. If you do not see The Ocular Migraine listed under "NOT OPTIMIZED", click on the drop down menu showing "NOT OPTIMZED" and select "ALL APPS". Find The Ocular Migrine and click on it and select "Dopn't optimized" then click DONE. If you have already found The Ocular Migraine set as NOT OPTIMIZED without changing anything, chances are the Quest will end up "optimizing" it later. So you may want to revisit these settings later on to change it back. I have found once I change it back manually, the Quest honors the user selection.

12. Next select "Notification Settings" from the MISC page.

13. Find The Ocular Migraine, if it's not already showing, you can select ALL APPS from the dropdown menu. Click on the toggle to DISABLE notificaitons for The Ocular Migraine. This is NOT required but recommended.

### NOTE: From now on, after each reboot of your device, the **FIRST** time you launch The Ocular Migraine, it will prompt you to "Allow USB debugging?". Select "Always allow from this computer" each time. This only happens on the initial launch of the applicaiton after a reboot of your device. It will not ask this question again until the next device reboot on it's inital launch.
