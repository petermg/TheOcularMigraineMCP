Message to my testers:
Ok, I think I'm almost ready for releasing
this application publicly.
HOWEVER, I think the version you have has a
broken update task. You can try to see if it updates
or not by going to ABOUT then
UPDATE AVAILABLE. The latest version code
is 966. If the updating doesn't work in your
version you can download the apk file 
from the github page just click on HELP
then it will take you to the GitHub page. You
can download the latest version from the RELEASES
section. I have ALSO uploaded this same version
to the Google Drive share I sent you as well.
Then you can go to TOOLS and select
INSTALL APK via ADB and select the apk file
to update. Looking foward to your feedback!
