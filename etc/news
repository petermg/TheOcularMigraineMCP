On the Quest 3 some people have reported
The Ocular Migraine still works on
firmware V74.
If you are on a Quest 3 and have Firmware V74
installed, please let me know.
Just go to my discord or github page.
Thank you.
Quest 2 still doesn't allow The Ocular
Migraine to run on firmware V74.

UDPATE:
I have also received confirmation
that The Ocular Migraine works fine
on Firmware V76 PTC on the Quest 3.
